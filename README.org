* a nix flake for [[https://github.com/SHoltzen/dice][dice]]

- ~nix build~ will build dice locally
- ~nix run .~ will run the dice binary
- ~nix develop~ will provide an ocaml dev environment (via [[https://github.com/tweag/opam-nix][opam-nix]]) with ~cargo~ and ~rustc~ for rsdd.
  If you are hacking on dice with this, I would recommend using a direnv environment of ~use flake ../path/to/this/repo --impure~ and adding a PR to support devenv.
